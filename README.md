* Chrome 83.0.4103.116
* Safari 13.1.1 

##### Overview
View your name as a Quantum Circuit.  Watch as the binary values of your name's letters create a quantum circuit with a set of quantum gates.  Run the circuit on a real IBM Quantum computer.  The final results are illustrated as colors representing the probabilty distribution of the quantum states.

##### Loading
To load locally, download the repository, install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) launch from your browser.

##### Instructions
Launch the Jupyter project.
Enter your name at the prompt.
Watch as your name is decoded and turned into a quantum circuit.
View the result as a graphical illustration. 

#####  Miscellany
The project is based on the [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) using [QisKit](https://qiskit.org/).  Thanks (as always) to IBM & Yale Quantum Institute.
